In this section, we will set up the user management service - **Cognito**, a serverless service to manage users and access permissions for AWS serverless resources for external users outside the system.

#### The steps include:
1. [Set up User Pool](6.1.UserPoolSetup/)
2. [Test the configured User Pool](6.2.LocalUserPooltest/)
3. [Set up Identity Pool](6.3.IdentityPoolSetup/)
4. [Assign permissions with Identity Pool](6.4.IdentityPoolRole/)
