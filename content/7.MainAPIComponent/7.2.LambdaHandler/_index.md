In this session, we will explore how to manage routes in **API Gateway** using **AWS Lambda**. We'll also learn how to direct all requests from the API Gateway to a single Lambda function. The Lambda function will then process tasks by splitting the route and handling them based on the specific path.

This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to simplify your architecture by using a single Lambda function to handle multiple routes. By routing all API Gateway requests to a central Lambda, you reduce the need for multiple function deployments and increase maintainability.

The steps for implementing this solution are as follows:

1. **[Setup AWS Lambda](7.2.1.LambdaFunction/)**  
   In this step, we will configure the AWS Lambda function that will handle all incoming requests. AWS Lambda allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers, which makes it an excellent choice for scalable backend services.

2. **[Handle API Route with AWS Lambda](7.2.2.APIGatewaySetup)**  
   After configuring the Lambda function, we need to set up the API Gateway to send all requests to Lambda. The Lambda function will then use logic to parse the incoming requests based on the route path and execute the corresponding actions.
