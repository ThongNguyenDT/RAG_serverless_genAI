In this section, we will configure the **API Gateway Authorizer** for the WebSocket API that was previously created. Setting up an Authorizer is crucial for enhancing security and controlling access to your API system. It allows for user authentication through secure mechanisms like **Lambda Authorizer**.

#### Steps to follow:

1. [Set up Lambda Function](7.3.1.LambdaFunction/)
2. [Set up WebSocket Authorizer in API Gateway](7.3.2.APIGatewaySetup/)


Configuring the Authorizer is an important step to enhance the security of your system. You can refer to detailed documentation on API Gateway and Lambda Authorizer to understand how to optimally configure these components.
