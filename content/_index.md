# Building a Serverless Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Solution on AWS

## Overview

In the evolving landscape of generative AI, integrating external, up-to-date information into large language models (LLMs) presents a significant advancement. This workshop guides you through building a truly serverless Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution on AWS. RAG empowers applications to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses by dynamically retrieving information from external sources. Our goal is to enable you to create a GenAI-powered application swiftly while keeping costs low and only paying for compute resources as needed.

## What and Why

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a method that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external information into their responses. Instead of relying solely on the static knowledge within the model, RAG dynamically pulls in relevant data from external databases, internet sources, or custom knowledge bases. This leads to more accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses.

### Why Use RAG?

- **Accuracy**: By incorporating real-time and domain-specific information, RAG significantly improves the accuracy of responses generated by LLMs.
- **Contextual Relevance**: RAG helps maintain context by pulling in specific, relevant information, making the interaction more meaningful and precise.
- **Up-to-date Information**: Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely on pre-trained data that may become outdated, RAG ensures that responses reflect the latest available information.
- **Cost-Effective**: The serverless nature of the architecture ensures that you only pay for what you use, minimizing costs associated with idle compute resources.

### Problems Addressed by RAG

- **Staleness**: LLMs may provide outdated information since their training data is static. RAG addresses this by fetching up-to-date data.
- **Inaccuracy**: Without real-time data retrieval, LLMs can make inaccurate assumptions. RAG reduces this by accessing reliable sources for information.
- **Scalability**: Traditional infrastructure requires extensive resource management, which can be costly and complex. A serverless approach scales automatically with demand.

## How to Solve

To solve the challenges of integrating up-to-date, accurate information into LLMs, we leverage a serverless architecture on AWS. This approach uses AWS Lambda for compute, Amazon Bedrock for generative AI capabilities, and various AWS services to store, retrieve, and manage data. By employing serverless technologies, we ensure that the solution is scalable, cost-effective, and easy to manage, making it ideal for deploying RAG applications.

### Key Components

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Powers the generation of answers and embedding of documents using state-of-the-art models.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes code in response to events, handling generation requests and embedding operations.
- **Amazon API Gateway (WebSocket)**: Manages real-time communication between the client and backend.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides user authentication and authorization.
- **AWS Amplify**: Simplifies the deployment of the front-end application.
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: Stores Docker images used by Lambda functions.
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts user documents and the LanceDB vector database.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Maintains a registry of documents and tracks WebSocket connection states.
- **Amazon SQS**: Queues notifications of new user uploads for embedding processes.

## Architecture

The architecture of our serverless RAG solution is designed to be modular and scalable, integrating several AWS services to handle different aspects of the application. Below is a diagram representing the architecture:

### Architectural Components and Workflow

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the front-end application, hosted on AWS Amplify, providing input queries and documents.
2. **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito handles user authentication and ensures secure access to the application.
3. **Request Handling**: Requests are sent via Amazon API Gateway (using WebSocket) to AWS Lambda functions.
4. **Data Storage**: User documents are stored in Amazon S3, with metadata tracked in Amazon DynamoDB.
5. **Document Embedding**: When new documents are uploaded, Amazon SQS notifies a Lambda function to generate embeddings using Amazon Bedrock. The embeddings are stored in LanceDB on S3.
6. **Response Generation**: For user queries, a Lambda function retrieves relevant data from LanceDB, processes it with Amazon Bedrock, and generates a contextually relevant response.
7. **Real-time Feedback**: The response is sent back to the user via the WebSocket connection managed by API Gateway.
